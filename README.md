### Explanation:
- **/pages**: Contains the main pages of your application, including the entry point (`index.js`) and custom application setup (`_app.js`). The `api` directory within `pages` is used for server-side API routes.
- **/components**: Houses reusable UI components like `Header`, `Footer`, and `Layout`.
- **/styles**: Contains global and module-specific CSS files for styling the application.
- **/public**: Used for static assets like images and the favicon.
- **/api**: Contains server-side logic for handling API requests.
- **.env**: Stores environment variables needed for configuration.
- **package.json**: Lists project dependencies and scripts.
- **README.md**: Provides documentation and instructions for the project.

This structure is designed to be modular and scalable, making it easier to maintain and extend the application.
